# Challenge 4 (extra tricky, no tests for this one!)
# 
# See if you can write a single function that USES all three of the functions 
# you wrote for the above challenges.
#
# It should:
# - prompt the user for the distance each runner in the relay race will run (in miles)
# - prompt the user for the number of runners in a team
# - print the total distance run by the team, in kilometers!
# 
# No need for this function to accept any arguments or return any values.
